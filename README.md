This is "QuizIt" names quizApp. Basically it conatins Javascript based quiz.
To store whole Questions and Options ,Correct Answers data I've used Object named database.
I've used Object as it can be extensible.Fine you can extend it as you wish.
I've used 3 functions here as showQuestions (to show quiz questions), result( to count your score), showLeaderBoard
(to show whole data of attended users).
Whole data of users who attempted quiz has stored in leaderBoard object.

So this is "QuizIt" Quizapp, which can be used on Command line Only.
